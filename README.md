Hii Steve,

This is a project regarding **KonvaJs drawing tools** using **ReactJS** , **KonvaJs** and **Tailwind** to complete.

## **USER authentication edit**
Can edit at `.env.local`  
`VITE_DEMO_USERS` to add or edit user login details

## **Bonus Features** (skipped)
- Custom shape creation  
- Group/ungroup objects  
- Version history  

## **PowerPoint PPTX**
Regarding the export to PowerPoint, there are 2 types of version.  
Can edit at `.env.local`  
`VITE_EXPORT_PPTX : 1` (default)  

Choose method **1** because PPTX does not support free drawing and also gradient color in shapes.  

1. Export to PPTX by using SVG converted to image and inserted into PPTX  
2. Export to PPTX using PPTX functions to draw  

## **Real-time collaboration**
I created a socket.io using Node.js.  
To run the collaboration you can get the code at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [NodeJs GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jiyoong1/NodeJs)  

README is ready.
